### The going ons. ###
Problem: Take in a text file of baseball player stats (We're in St. Louis so if you didn't expect the Cardinals people might be offended) and return a ranking of players for that season based on a calculated batting average. 
Goals: Functionality and a better understanding of working in Python. 

Included: 
1. Textfile of data 
2. Module4_BattingAvg.py - My first soluntion. A brute force, let's just iterate through some dictionaries, method of parsing input data and returning what a user wants. Original strive for functionality. 
3. Module4_other.py - A more elegant solution! Always trying to make that code more modular. Here is a solution to the same problem using an object-oriented approach. Much nicer to look at, better run time. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Ussage: python3 Module4_BattingAvg.py filename.txt
